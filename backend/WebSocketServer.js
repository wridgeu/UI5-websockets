/**
 * Simple WS Server
 * 
 * During initial connection build-up we send a greeting message to the UI.
 * Any message after that which has 'Ping' as payload, will just print out "Pong!"
 * while pretending to be a SAP PcP message (as we add some key called 'pcpFields' for context information).
 * 
 * We basically use simple straight up WebSocket but pretend that this one specific message
 * somewhat looks like a PCP one. ^^
 * 
 * UI Port 8080
 * WS Port 8081
